## Evaluate CAViaR by Quantile Regression
### Quick Summary
This is a group project of SDSC6013 Topics in Financial Engineering and Technology. We built a value-at-risk model directly modeling the quantile return directly by referring the paper CAViaR: Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk by Regression Quantiles by Engle and Manganelli (2004).

We constructed two libraries: `caviar` and `var_tests` to model the value at risk and backtest the VaR estimate. For presentation, we constructed a dashboard to showcase how it can be possibly applied. If you are looking for some inspiration, we strongly suggest to take a look of the documentation below and the code in `notebook-example`.

Libraries:
1. CAViaR Model `caviar`
2. VaR Test `var_tests`

Demo Application:
1. Dashboard `dashboard`
